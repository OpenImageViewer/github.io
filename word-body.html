                    Open Image viewer was created out of the need to create a truly high performant, efficient and open source application backed up by a strong community.
                    </br>
                </br>
                    High performance doesn't mean just fast code.

                    The application tries to follow the zero-overhead principle of its programming language(C++). "What you don't use, you don't pay".
                </br>
                    For example, the GUI is designed to be pluginable. Some users prefer doing most operations with keyboard shortcuts and for that the application is currently supplied with the bare minimum GUI.
            </br>
        </br>
                    In a more general sense, efficiency could mean how much effort and time is spent in relation to the outcome,
                    or in this specific case, minimum user interaction.
                    <br/>

                    A simple example would be to select a specific part of an image and copy it to the clipboard.
                    <br/>
                    With Open Image Viewer the process is intuitive, dynamic and visually optimized.
                    <br/>
                    Many of these small but important features are thought-out, making the experience overall much more harmonized.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Experienced users usually do pay attention to these subtle nuances and may be able to appreciate in what way it'll contribute to their workflow.
                    <br/>
                    It's a challenging task conveying these nuances with text, or even a video.
                    Self experience would be best, thus I would suggest to just try it yourself.

                    In its current form the application is intended for developers and power users.
                    <br/>
                    With time, UI abstraction layers will be formed and stabilized that will make the application usage literally a child's play.

                    Currently there are use cases that are not-solved or not polished.
