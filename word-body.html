                            For years I was a dedicated user of <a class="word-link" href="http://www.nyam.pe.kr/dev/imagine/">Imagine</a> by <a class="word-link" href="http://www.nyam.pe.kr"> Sejin Chun</a>.
                            It is a great piece of software but it started to become obsolete as it wasn't been maintained for years.
                            <br/>
                            Over the years I've been working with numerous image viewers, but I couldn't find one that is comfortable to work with,
                            customizable and fast.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Open Image viewer was created out of the need for a truly high performant, efficient and open source application backed up by a strong community.
                    </br>
                    Currently it's my daily driver and whenever I need a new functionality, I simply add it.
                    <a class="word-link" href="https://github.com/OpenImageViewer/OpenImageViewer/issues">Any request is welcomed.</a>

                Comfort is the first pillar of Open Image Viewer.
               </br>
                All the operations should be customizable for full personalization.
                That also means innovating small shortcuts to achieve the goals with higher efficiency.

            <p class="container has-text-left has-text-weight-semibold word-paragraph">
                Efficiency is the second pillar of Open Image Viewer.
                The application tries to follow the <a class="word-link" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/Zero-overhead_principle">zero-overhead principle </a> of its programming language(C++). "What you don't use, you don't pay".
            </br>
                The application is designed for efficiency and customization for example: the GUI is an 
                optional feature that you can download.
                </p>
                
            </br>

        <p class="container has-text-left has-text-weight-semibold word-paragraph">
                    In a more general sense, efficiency could mean <i>effort relative to outcome</i>, or in this specific case, minimum user interaction.
                    <br/>

                    A simple example would be to <a class="word-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As9MhCOlGIU">select a specific part of an image and copy it to the clipboard. </a>
                    <br/>
                    With Open Image Viewer the process is intuitive, dynamic and visually optimized.
                    <br/>
                    Many of these small but important thought-out features are making the experience overall much more harmonized.
                    <br/>
                    It's a challenging task conveying these nuances with text, or even a video.
                    Self experience would be best, thus I would suggest to just try it yourself.

                    At the moment, the main focus of the project is to implement features targeted for industry professionals
                    and to complete the cross-platform implementation.

                    The application is not perfect (yet).
